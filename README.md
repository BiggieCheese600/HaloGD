This project is completely non profit and is made only for learning purposes. I am NOT responsible for how this project
will be used. Any distributions of the game are not by me, as if anybody would like to play this project, they will have to download godot and
export to whatever platform on their own. Do not trust unofficial downloads of this game on other website than this repo, the safest way to play would be to make your own
executable for whatever platform you want.
